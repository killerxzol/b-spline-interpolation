# b-spline-interpolation
B-spline or basis spline is a spline function that has minimal support with respect to a given degree, smoothness, and domain partition.

This program builds cubic B-splines for a given sequence of vertices in 3D space.

*Note: A curve composed of B-splines will not pass exactly through the given points.*
